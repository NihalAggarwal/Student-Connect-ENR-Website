            <p>Initial Observations</p>
  
            
            <ul class="theme-list">
              <li class="list-item">In a survey conducted by us, we got to know that most of the students get to know their seniors and alumnis through various club events</li>
              <li class="list-item">However, due to various reasons like less personal interaction, low participation from the students made it rather unfruitful</li>
            </ul>
   
            
            <ul class="theme-list">
              <li class="list-item"> We thought of various ways to increase the participation by hosting events like music concerts, game nights, movie screening</li>
              <li class="list-item">These type of events are more inclined to create bond between the students where the enviornment is generally informal , which directly help the students to network.</li>
            </ul>
            
            
            <ul class="theme-list">
              <li class="list-item">However, due to the pandemic the efficieny of these kind of events in the form of online meetings is proven to be less effective as students have already high amount of screen time in the day</li>
              <li class="list-item">Hence we had to drop off this idea from our consideration</li>

            <h3 class="mb-3">Social Media </h3>
            <p>Some of the pros and cons for the idea of using social media is given as below</p>
            <ul class="theme-list">
              <li class="list-item"> We had thought of building our idea around a social media campaign that especially focused on the freshman students</li>
              <li class="list-item"> As most of the  college students are active on social media like Facebook and Instagram it is very easy to gather audience in a large number </li>
              <li class="list-item">The idea was to create a forum where queries of first year students regarding college are answered by the students in senior year.</li>
              <li class="list-item">Also, this forum was going to be the one stop solution of announcing of all the activities going in the campus community</li>
             
              <li class="list-item"> However, we had noticed that maintaing such a large online community is hard as due to increase in the content, the posts are generally being "scrolled down" by the students</li>
              <li class="list-item"> Students generally use these type of social media platforms to keep up with the entairtainment stuff like memes and movies and they generally are inactive in college forums after a period of time</li>
              <li class="list-item">Hence we had to drop the idea of building our solution around social media</li>

              <li class="list-item"> The features like messaging, searching by tags and posting queries are already being used in apps like Instagram and Quora</li>
              <li class="list-item"> Hence, it will be an easy to use and navigate platform for the users</li>

      <h2>Motivation for our Project</h2>
      <p>Student life drastically progresses and flourishes into certain phases from the start of their academic journey after higher secondary education. This transition from a contemporary educational establishment might be rough for students who want to excel in the preliminary years of university.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="container right">
    <div class="content">
      <p>Students find themselves in a dilemma for selection of resources in terms of recommended study material to establish a better understanding in their subject of interests apart from the university curriculum, exposure to experienced and veteran interdisciplinary students for proper guidance, and more importantly optimum supervision for their progressive stimuli for future endeavors.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="container left">
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Our Solution</h2>
      <p>We are making the app Student Connect which helps the user to join an online student community of their college so that it becomes easier for the user to communicate with its peers.
        </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="container right">
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Why Student Connect?</h2>
      <p>There are several apps available already in the market which provide efficient communication ability for students but they can also initiate a certain level of distraction which our app might not.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="container left">
    <div class="content">
      <h2>What is Student Connect?</h2>
      <p>We have made the app Student Connect which works on the basis of email instead of phone numbers. To be more specific, it works on the basis of University Email. Every student has a university email though which he/she can receive important updates about the college.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="container right">
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Creating Rooms</h2>
      <p>Now, here we can argue that there are hundreds of students in the college so, how can a fresher know whom to mail and be sure it’s the correct person he/she is mailing. This is where our app’s main functioning comes in. We have created rooms for different fields of people based on the survey we did for learning about their interests.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="container left">
    <div class="content">
      <p>For example, we have created groups like Web Development, Android Development, Machine Learning, etc. which helps a student find his/her respective field of interest and can connect with the peers in that group.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="container right">
    <div class="content">
      <h2>What about Hackers/Intruders?</h2>
      <p>We can also assure that no intruders will be found in the chatrooms which happens nowadays very frequently. The reason is that we will only allow the university students based on their email ids.</p>
