          <hr>
          <p>In the freshman year of our college, apart from the inital induction program and occasional alumni meetups we didn't had any other way to be in contact with our seniors and alumni. </p>
          <p> It was a great challenge for us to look for a person with similar interests in technical as well as social skills to get some guidance </p>
          <p> We particularly focused on the problem of bringing the seniors and junior closer. The seniors are generally good at a particular skill or two. Meanwhile, the juniors sometimes need guidance and a helping hand be it academic or non academic<p>
          <p> There was no solution available in the market for this problem. Hence we decided to bridge this gap by bulding a platform that caters the demands of the problem statement<p>

         
          <p> The features in our app are inspired from multiple social media platforms to create a solution that fits all the needs of a student in the context of our problem statement<p>
          <p> In the app, user selects certain skills which he/she is good at. While searching for the person you are shown the skills , their domain of study and the year they are currenty studying<p>
          <p> Also, there is a feature of searching by skills. Let's say you want to contact someone who is good at a partcular skill. You can get all the names of users in your college who are interested in that skill and collabarating has never been this easy!<p>
            <p> Through a survey conducted by us, we came to know that students would like a group dedicated for a particular skill where they can post their quries and get them answered from other users. This inspired us to create group chat rooms for different skills.<p>
              <p> In the app, there are discussion forums for selected number of skills which we believe will be most helpful to the juniors as they can get multiple perspective of their question.<p>
          <p> When given an opuurtunity to solve a real life problem in ENR course and everything happening online , we thought it was the perfect time to build a platform where only the students of a same college can connect easily with their peers, seniors and alumni as well. </p>
